## Weights & Biases

Weights & Biases helps you keep track of your machine learning projects by logging metrics and hyperparamters from your runs. It creates a dashboard containing all your experiments, enabling one to compare them easily. 

PyTorch Lightning has an in-built logger integrated with Weights & Biases, called `WandbLogger` which automatically logs the metrics specified (training loss, validation loss, etc.) in the `LightningModule`. The model checkpoints from Lightning also get automatically logged via WandB as `Artifacts`, which can be used easily later on.

It helps you build comprehensive charts, compare models across various parameters and build exquisite dashboards of the like shown above. To get started with this, just login to your [wandb account](https://wandb.ai/), running once `wandb login`. Configure the logging parameters in `conf/logging/` and you'll be good to go!
