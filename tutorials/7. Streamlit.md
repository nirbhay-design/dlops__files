## Streamlit

Streamlit is a Python library that makes it easy to create custom web apps for machine learning and data science. It is very intuitive to use and helps to build elegant web pages to showcase your model.

Working with Streamlit is simple. First you sprinkle a few Streamlit commands into a normal Python script. For example, `st.text` writes raw text to your app, `st.line_chart` draws a line chart, and so on. Once you've drawn all the required elements for the GUI, you can simply run it with:

```bash
streamlit run <python_script>.py
```

As soon as you run this script, a local Streamlit server will be create and your app can be viewed on that server.

The cool thing about Streamlit is that every time you want to change the code, just save the file. Every time there's a change in the source files, Streamlit will ask you automatically whether you want to re-run your app. You can even set it to re-run every time you update the source code. This makes the development process smooth and allows one to work in a fast interactive loop and create elegant interactive web pages.
